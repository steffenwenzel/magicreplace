# ✨ magicreplace ✨

magicreplace is a search/replace class with zero overhead.

## Intro

###

When moving databases, usually the url environment also changes.
If the URL is hardcoded in the database (like WordPress [does](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/design-decisions/#absolute-versus-relative-urls)), those URLs have to be changed.
If you now do a search and replace on your entire database to change the URLs,
you will corrupt data that has been serialized. Just try out
```php
unserialize(str_replace('www.foo.tld','www.barrr.tld',serialize('url=www.foo.tld')));
```
and you will get an ugly error.

### There already exist cool tools that solve this issue, for example...

* [Velvet Blues Update URLs](https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/)
* [Better Search Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-search-replace/)
* [Suchen & Ersetzen](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/search-and-replace/)
* [WP-CLI's search-replace](http://wp-cli.org/commands/search-replace/)
* [Search and Replace for WordPress Databases Script](https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/)

### How is magicreplace different from those tools?

* Blazingly fast (~1sec runtime on 100mb database file with 300.000 rows)
* Lightweight: only 7kb in size
* File based: does not need a database or a wp installation - works on plain (sql) files
* Multi replace: does multiple replaces
* Considers edge cases: objects/classes inside serialized strings
* Can be used either with the command line or as a class
* Acts carefully: If serialization fails, nothing is changed

### Warning

This does not prevent you from taking backups. Use this script at your own risk.
